# pyremarkify

This tool converts the input markdown file in beautiful set of HTML presentation slides using [remarkjs](http://remarkjs.com/).

Its very simple to use, just provide the markdown file name as an argument to this tool. The slides itself is defined by three consecutive dashes `---` on a line. See the `sample_input.md` file for complete usage.
